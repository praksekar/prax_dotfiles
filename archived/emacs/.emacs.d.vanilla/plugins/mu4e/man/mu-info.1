.SH NAME

mu info \- show information about the mu database

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B mu info [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmu info\fR is the \fBmu\fR command for getting information about the mu
database.

.SH OPTIONS

Note, some of the general options are described in the \fBmu(1)\fR man-page and
not here, as they apply to multiple mu commands.

.TP
\fB\-\-muhome\fR
use an alternative directory to store and read the database, write the logs,
etc. By default, \fBmu\fR uses XDG Base Directory Specification (e.g. on Linux
this defaults to \fI~/.cache/mu\fR, \fI~/.config/mu\fR). Earlier versions of
\fBmu\fR defaulted to \fI~/.mu\fR, which now requires \fI\-\-muhome=~/.mu\fR.

.SH RETURN VALUE

\fBmu init\fR returns 0 upon successful completion, or a non-zero exit code if
there was some error.
