Welcome to ~mu~!

*Note*: you are looking at the *development* branch, which is where new code is being developed and
tested, and which may occasionally break.

Distribution and non-adventurous users are instead recommended to use the 1.4.x Release Branch [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/tree/release/1.4.x][1.4.x
Release Branch]] or to pick up one of the [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases][1.4.x Releases]].

Given the enormous amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance of e-mail message in our
work-flows, it's essential to quickly deal with all that mail - in particular, to instantly find
that one important e-mail you need right now, and quickly file away message for later use.

~mu~ is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the Maildir-format. ~mu~'s purpose in life is
to help you to quickly find the messages you need; in addition, it allows you to view messages,
extract attachments, create new maildirs, and so on. See the [mu cheatsheet] for some examples. =mu=
is fully documented.

After indexing your messages into a [[http://www.xapian.org][Xapian]]-database, you can search them
using a custom query language. You can use various message fields or words in the body text to find
the right messages.

Built on top of ~mu~ are some extensions (included in this package):

- mu4e: a full-featured e-mail client that runs inside emacs

- mu-guile: bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language (version 2.2 and later)

~mu~ is written in C and C++; ~mu4e~ is written in elisp, and ~mu-guile~ in a mix of C and Scheme.

Note, ~mu~ is available in Linux distributions (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora) under the name
~maildir-utils~; apparently because they don't like short names. The all of the code is distributed
under the terms of the [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GNU General Public License version 3]] (or higher).
