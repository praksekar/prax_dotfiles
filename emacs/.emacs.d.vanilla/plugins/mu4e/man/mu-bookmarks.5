.SH NAME

bookmarks \- file with bookmarks (shortcuts) for mu search expressions

.SH DESCRIPTION

Bookmarks are named shortcuts for search queries. They allow using a convenient
name for often-used queries. The bookmarks are also visible as shortcuts in the
mu experimental user interfaces, \fImug\fR and \fImug2\fR.

The bookmarks file is read from \fI<muhome>/bookmarks\fR. On Unix this would
typically be w be \fI~/.config/mu/bookmarks\fR, but this can be influenced using
the \fB\-\-muhome\fR parameter for \fBmu-find\fR(1) and \fBmug\fR(1).

The bookmarks file is a typical key=value \fB.ini\fR-file, which is best shown
by means of an example:

.nf
    [mu]
    inbox=maildir:/inbox                  # inbox
    oldhat=maildir:/archive subject:hat   # archived with subject containing 'hat'
.fi

The \fB[mu]\fR group header is required.

For practical uses of bookmarks, see \fBmu-find\fR(1).
